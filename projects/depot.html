									<h1>Elections Depot</h1>

								<p>The elections depot was our warehouse for elections equipment and my "home away from home" so to speak.</p>
								<p>For the majority of my time in Linn County, I was in charge of the building, including operations within and organization.</p>
								<br />
								
								<h3>Operations</h3>
								<p>For bigger elections, we brought in a team of temporary workers to help pack materials and test equipment for about 80 locations. This generally lasted 2 months at a time.</p>
								<p>On paper, I was never in charge of these workers, but in reality, I managed basically all aspects of their work other than pay. I would provide materials, guidance on procedures, and answer any questions they had during their time there.</p>
								
								<h3>Organization</h3>
								<p>Early 2020, I became the sole permanent employee in this location. I used the opportunity to reorganize pretty much everything in order to increase efficiency.</p>
								<p>Materials were separated by where they needed to go and materials were separated so we could update, replace, and inventory things as needed.</p>
