							<section>
								<p>Usually my go-to was Access Databases when managing data, but there were several instances where I used Excel instead out of preference or because Access couldn't do what I needed.</p>
								<p>Everybody uses Excel, but I used it for some crazy things. Some examples:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Calculating clock out times to hit a certain number of hours.</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/clock.png" class="imgexpand" alt="There are options to add/remove a lunch and if you wanted a set clock out time with an adjusted lunch instead." />
									</div>
									
									<li>Generating a batch file to set up hundreds of laptop users with specific passwords based on the computer number. (so we didn't have to set each manually anymore. No screenshot of this one)</li>
									<br />
									
									<li>A searchable inventory database.</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/inventory.png" class="imgexpand" alt="This tab would pull from a big inventory list. It's all based on formulas. No coding." />
									</div>
									
									<li>Assigning election workers.</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/excel_assign.png" class="imgexpand" alt="This tab was a visual to show who was assigned at each location, what parties they were, and some other stats. This was all formula-based and was pulling from several reports on different sheets pulled from our database." />
									</div>
									
									<li>Using a macro to generate ballot marking instructions for hundreds of ballots to get unique results for each candidate. (I have a video of this, but it's not pretty and it doesn't really explain anything.)</li>
									<br />
									
									<li>Generating barcodes for scannable training IDs.</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/barcodes.png" class="imgexpand" alt="This is where you input the barcode you want to generate." />
										<img src="img/excel/barcodes2.png" class="imgexpand" alt="This is the resulting code, which can be entered into a barcode site to generate the barcode on the back of your driver's license. Some of the info we didn't use was static, so I blacked it out, just in case." />
									</div>
									
									<li>Providing visual snapshots of online training progress based on an exported report.</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/moodle.png" class="imgexpand" alt="This was a quick way to see who was / wasn't done with training. This pulled info from a report generated from Moodle pasted into another tab. The gray Ns are people who didn't complete chair training, but didn't have to. The red ones are people who didn't choose a class." />
									</div>
									
									<li>Automatic calculation of election type and deadlines based on election date.</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/dates.png" class="imgexpand" alt="Ignore the 504 error... That might be because I'm using LibreOffice to take the screenshot." />
										<img src="img/excel/dates2.png" class="imgexpand" alt="This is the formula in one of the 504 error cells. I'm going to go ahead and not fix it..." />
									</div>
									
									<li>A map of the building, where you can type keywords and it will highlight the applicable department.</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/map.png" class="imgexpand" alt="Notice the assessor's office is green, which is where you go for homestead." />
									</div>
									
									<li>(Google Sheets) Assisting with assigning potential election workers to recruitment meetings.</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/class.png" class="imgexpand" alt="There were two dropdowns, one for the day, one for time. Once you picked a day, it would show all available times and how many people were assigned to that class, so you didn't over-assign." />
									</div>
									
									<li>(Google Sheets) Automatically generating sign-in sheets for the above classes</li>
									<div id="thumbnails">
										<img src="img/excel/class2.png" class="imgexpand" alt="A printable sheet that pulled contact info for everyone in the class and functioned as a sign-in sheet. They could update their info, if needed, when they signed in." />
									</div>
