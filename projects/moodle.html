									<h1>Moodle</h1>

								<p>A co-worker and I worked started our own online training initiative using the Moodle platform. After that co-worker left, I finished developing and maintained it myself.</p>
								<p>The training was for election day workers, and eventually expanded to training our technicians and others. All of it was made from scratch using the tools available within Moodle and some custom html/css as well.</p><br />
								
								<p class="note">Much of the actual content could be considered sensitive, so most of the screenshots are of the overview screens.</p><br />
								<p class="note">Click on images below to see full size and see more info.</p><br />
								
								<h3>Login Screen</h3>
								<p>Anyone could create an account, but to get into the class you needed the enrollment key. This made managing 800+ workers manageable. It also allowed me to put workers into a specific group based on the enrollment key they used, which controlled what content they could see. A chairperson would see more than a standard worker, for example.</p>

								</div>
								
								<h3>Election Worker Training</h3>
								<p>Election workers had two different trainings: Check-in and Chairperson. The chairperson training had all the same materials, but more materials for a chairperson. They would basically be the supervisor of the other workers at that location.</p>
								<p>Highlights:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Links to skip optional sections</li>
									<li>Pictures and bios of staff members</li>
									<li>Overview of election day and materials</li>
									<li>Mandatory quizzes (quick to reinforce key info)</li>
									<li>Screenshots and videos of the process</li>
									<li>Selection of classes based on the group they are in (so a chairperson doesn't end up in a standard class, for example)</li>
								</ul>
								<div id="thumbnails">

								</div>
								
								<h3>Election Day Reference</h3>
								<p>I figured out I could put a link to this course on the iPads that go out on election day, so I made a reference page to help workers who felt inclined to look it up. The table of contents linked to different sections throughout the day. In each section, there was documentation, videos, and guides.</p>
								<div id="thumbnails">

								</div>
								
								<h3>Office Worker Training</h3>
								<p>This was the basic office worker training. It was referenced in technician training and other office worker trainings as the basics, so I didn't have to recreate the wheel for each.</p>
								<div id="thumbnails">
									<img src="img/moodle/Office Worker Training_s.png" class="imgexpand" alt="" />
								</div>
								
								<h3>Technician Training</h3>
								<p>Training for our technicians.</p>
								<p>Highlights:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>How-to videos.</li>
									<li>Deep dives into election equipment, with several screenshots.</li>
									<li>Sections based on individual tasks, in case someone popped in to help on something specific.</li>
									<li>(There was no actual test)</li>
								</ul>
