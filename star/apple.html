									<h1>Automation: <br />Apple IDs</h1>

								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<p>At AT&amp;T, our Hiawatha warehouse team needed to create hundreds of unique Apple IDs for a customer, which led the team to enlist the warehouse team, the support team (my team), and anyone else who was available to manually type in all needed information and create Apple IDs one-by-one to meet deadlines.</p>
								
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<p>A co-worker and I thought there had to be a better way to accomplish this. We decided to try and automate it using a program called AutoHotkey. I wasn't a "decision maker" at the time, so if a better solution existed, I wasn't going to be the one to make it.</p>
								
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<p>We started with AutoHotkey macros, which recorded keypresses and mouse clicks, and then let you play them back. We used this to automate the process of filling out an iTunes form over and over.</p>
								
								<p>AutoHotkey also allows you to program actions from scratch, which allowed for much greater control. So I took the lead to create a script that would copy user info from an Excel spreadsheet and fill out the forms.</p>
								
								<p>The biggest hang up was that it would sometimes load the next page quickly, and sometimes hang for several minutes. To address this, I had the program scan for specific elements only on the page we were looking for before proceeding. If it waited several minutes with no response, it would start over.</p>
								
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<p>We went from our whole office making the Apple IDs to a small team of temp workers running my script. Then we got to the point where it would run on a single computer that someone just needed to check on every once-in-a-while to make sure it was still going. Saved us a ton of repetitive work and money on workers. As far as I'm aware, this script was in use until the location was closed and operations moved to Atlanta.</p>
