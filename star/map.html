								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<p>Assigning hundreds of workers to about 80 polling locations was always a monumental task. We had several tools to assist with the process, including a Microsoft Access database for the actual assignments, which showed mileage based on Google Maps API once someone was assigned to a location. This was nice, but it didn't help me actually assign the workers.</p>
								
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<p>I needed a way to make intelligent decisions when assigning workers. I had to take into consideration where my available workers were, so I didn't have people going across the county. We paid mileage, and at 6 AM and 10 PM, travelling that far could be dangerous.</p>
								
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<p>I utilized Google Maps along with exports from our database. This allowed me to visualize where my available workers were and where I needed people.</p>
								
								<p>I made several SQL queries for different situations, like locations that needed Democrats or Republicans (locations legally needed to be party balanced). I had exports that had my workers and their parties, so I could color code them based on parties. Putting them on a map of Linn County allowed me to take the river into consideration, and find the best person for the location, not just someone who is close.</p>
								
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<p>This undoubtedly saved tax-payer dollars on mileage spent for poll workers. It also made the poll workers' lives easier, as I didn't have them travelling across the county after a 16 hour day.</p>
