								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<p>We needed a one-size-fits-all training that didn’t lose worker interest for being too long and didn’t miss small, but important legal details.</p>
								
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<p>A co-worker and I started online training using the Moodle platform. We had to streamline it while keeping little details.</p>
								
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<p>We created training from scratch and used a glossary feature that allowed people to click on a word to go into more details about that particular item. Workers could skim the basics, or go into more detail as they wanted.</p>
								
								<p>We had tests to drive important points and verify everyone was on the same page.</p>
								
								<p>I also added different login keys (course passwords) for different roles. If you were a chairperson, you would have a specific chairperson key that took you to chairperson training. So everyone was in the same place for training, even if they had different training materials.</p>
								
								<p>Training eventually got to the point where you could skip the basics if you’ve worked prior.</p>
								
								<p>Training was further streamlined with pictures, videos, and linked guides, including the exact copies of what they would see on election day. The focus was put on where to find the materials, instead of memorizing the content.</p>
								
								<p>In-person training sign-up was only available once online training was complete.</p>
								
								<p>Lastly, I added a course that was just for reference, which included several documents and guides. I put a link to this page on the workers iPads for election day, so they could use their check-in iPads to find answers, if they chose to do so. They had a password on their documentation to access it, so it wasn't public and they didn't have to find their log in.</p>
								
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<p>Everyone took online training prior to each election, which allowed us to focus in-person training on hands-on practice with the technology. We could run reports on the workers’ completion of the online training, but not necessary most times, since they could only sign up to in-person training if it was done.</p>
								
								<p>We could also focus training on quiz questions that were answered incorrectly by most people.</p>
