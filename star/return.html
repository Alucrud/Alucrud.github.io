									<h1>Reporting:<br>Tracking Returned Materials</h1>

								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<p>At the end of election day, we received materials from about 80 polling locations. Each location had iPads, ballot materials, and other legal documents. All of these materials arrived around the same time on election night (9-11 PM at night after voting since 7 AM)</p>
								
								<p>A few of us accepted the materials, verified we received everything, and put the materials away. This is hectic. The first thing to go when things got hectic was verifying all of the materials.</p>
								
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<p>Being frustrated with the process, I tried to find a better way to accept materials, so we could do it quickly and accurately.</p>
								
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<p>We had barcode scanners, so I added custom barcodes to all the materials we had sent out. This was mostly automatic, with some Microsoft Word fields and mail merge.</p>
								
								<p>Next, I created a Microsoft Access database that automatically pulled all the equipment we used for that election from another database. We knew what was issued and where.</p>
								
								<p>Lastly, on this database, it had a single field to input barcodes, so when a barcode was scanned, it was entered into the database. Based on the formatting of the barcode, we knew what type of item it was, what location it came from, and if there was a number associated with it.</p>
								
								<p>I could then run a report that visualized each location and color coded what we had and didn't have, automatically.</p>
								
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<p>Receiving materials went drastically faster. At a glance, we could see what materials we had and what we were missing. From there we could track down what we were missing.</p>
