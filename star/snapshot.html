								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<p>The election deputy was, understandably, concerned about workers finishing online training in time and wanted progress updates for online training. We needed to know how many people completed training, who was still in progress, and who hasn't yet signed up for an in-person training class.</p>
								
								<p>We used Moodle for online training, which had user reports in CSV format. It listed all users on one side, and a list of each class along the top with either 'Completed' or 'Incomplete', which resulted in a huge blob of text that didn't provide a quick method to visualize what was happening.</p>
								
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<p>My task was to give a concise visual of this data on a regular basis while online training was taking place over a number of weeks.</p>
								
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<p>Using Excel, I had a worksheet where you could copy/paste the existing export. On another worksheet, it would use formulas and conditional formatting to automatically present that same information in an easy-to-read format.</p>
								
								<p>I also took exports from our database, which matched up with the user information using index matching to give us data about the worker. This way, we could use the same spreadsheet to contact anyone who wasn't finished and see what the hold up was. If they weren't able to finish it, we could see where they were assigned to quickly adjust assignments.</p>
								
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<p>Every week (or day, closer to election day) I would export the data and copy/paste it into the snapshot spreadsheet, which took minutes. We then used the snapshot to make adjustments to assignments, notify workers of incomplete training, or sign them up for in-person training, as necessary.</p>
