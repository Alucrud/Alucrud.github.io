									<h1>Software Solution: <br />Write-ins</h1>

								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<p>After each election with options for write-in candidates, the election office needs to tally write-in votes. During my time at Linn County, this was done by temporary employees who hand-typed write-ins that were scanned from paper ballots by ballot tabulators.</p>
								
								<p>Originally, this was done in Excel, then added to a Microsoft Access table for report formatting. The difficulty came from multiple people typing a list of write-ins separately, then trying to combine this list and form a single tally. You also weren't sure who did what, and variety in naming can add more confusion.</p>
								
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<p>After seeing this process in action, I knew I had the experience to make a better solution.</p>
								
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<p>I made a single Access database with SQL and VBA solution which had a front-end application, and a unified back-end database of entries.</p>
								
								<p>This allowed our workers to 'log in' with their name, so we could keep track of who did what. The database had existing precincts and contests, speeding up input and eliminating naming variations. Then you simply typed in the name and submitted, which had an automatically timestamped history of what only that user entered, so they could fix any mistakes as they go.</p>
								
								<p>Also, I added the option to include name variations to simplify tallying thousands of write-in votes. For example, It allowed you to say "John Smith" was counted toward "Jonathan Smith", and generated a note on the report of which variations counted for which candidates, for added transparency.</p>
								
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<p>We eliminated the need for someone to manage the logistics of the write-ins, speeding up the process and reducing the opportunity for errors. Once the write-ins were entered, we had them all in one place. Anyone on our team could pull the report. If any investigation needed to happen, we had a record of who did what and when. Finally, tallying the votes became much easier, as the report automatically showed who had the most votes, and consolidated name variations.</p>
