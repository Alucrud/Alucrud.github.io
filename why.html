								<h3>Why Mark?</h3>
								<p> I have over a decade of experience troubleshooting technology, documenting technical procedures, and using existing tools to automate. In every job I have had, technical or not, I have leveraged technology to solve complex problems and improve procedures. This extends into my personal life, with things like smart home automations, custom scripts to filter job postings, utlizing AI to create, etc. Technology is much more than just a job to me.</p>
								
								<h4 style="padding-top:10px;margin-left:50px;">Check out examples here:</h4>
								<a style="margin-left:50px;" href="star.html">STAR Examples Page</a>
								
								<p style="padding-top:10px;">I perform my job duties admirably and regularly go above and beyond. I am usually self-motivated and require little to no supervision to accomplish tasks. I think, given the opportunity, I will impress you.</p>
								
								<h4 style="padding-top:10px;margin-left:50px;">...but don't just take my word for it. See some of the kudos I have received:</h4>

								<h3>My History</h3>
								<h4 style="padding-top:0px;">...in Elections</h4>
								<p>I came into elections with no prior election experience. I started as a contractor focusing on equipment prep for several months, before being hired on as a permanent employee. My job was geared more towards working with election official volunteers: assigning to locations, training, and paying them. I had to learn quickly without much guidance, as my predecessor was not the type to leave documentation.</p>
								
								<p>I quickly acclimated to my position and made it my own, using technology to solve the complex problems with the job. I also continued responsibilities with the technology until that became my full-time job (a newly created job, based on work I was doing). My goal during much of this time was modernizing, standardizing, and documenting procedures, eliminating the need for institutional knowledge.</p>
								
								<h4>...at AT&amp;T</h4>
								<p>Before elections, I worked at AT&amp;T Mobility Solutions. I started as a contractor before being hired on full time to support ruggedized devices over the phone for a handful of companies. During my time there, our department shifted from that to Mobile Device Management support. We supported a much larger number of admins and end user's to manage their MDM solutions.</p>
								
								<p>My focus at AT&amp;T became automation and documentation. I became the subject matter expert (SME) for one MDM solution we supported and worked with the other SME to document troubleshooting procedures. I created software solutions to speed up and standardize ticket creation along with setting up custom Apple IDs for customers.</p>
								
								<h4>...and the rest</h4>
								<p>Earlier jobs were over-the-phone tech support jobs. I supported network equipment for hotels at Ovation Networks. Before that, I remotely installed and supported anti-virus software at Security Coverage as a student intern.</p>
